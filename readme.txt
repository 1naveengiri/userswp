Light weight frontend user registration, login plugin.

== Description ==

We always liked BuddyPress a lot, but we are aware that not everyone needs a full blown social network for their website, in fact, for most websites BuddyPress is considered an overkill.

What most websites need are a Front End Register form with custom fields and form builder, a Login Form, Users Profiles and a Members Directory.

Because We donâ€™t particularly love any of the solutions that are already available on the market, we find them bloated with far too many options, we decided to work on one ourselves and create a simple and lightweight solution.

Should you find any bug, please report it in the support forum and we will fix it asap!

UsersWP is 100% translatable.
